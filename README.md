# 🚀 Speckit Network Monitor 🚀

**(A fun, little network buddy for your Mac!)**

Hey there, internet traveler! 👋 Ever feel like your internet connection has a mind of its own? One minute you're streaming cat videos in glorious 4K, and the next... poof! 💨 You're staring at the dreaded loading spinner. We've all been there, and that's why we built Network Monitor!

## 🤔 What's the Big Idea?

Network Report is a simple, friendly, and powerful network monitor that lives in your macOS menu bar. It's designed to give you a clear and instant picture of your network's health without being a clunky, complicated mess.

**It helps you answer questions like:**

*   Is my Wi-Fi really working? 📶
*   Is the server for my favorite game down, or is it just me? 🎮
*   Why is my video call so choppy all of a sudden? 🐢
*   How stable is my connection, really? 🧐

Think of it as your personal network detective, always on the case! 🕵️‍♀️

## ✨ Features ✨

*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Keep a constant eye on your network connectivity.
*   **Simple Status Icons:** A quick glance tells you if everything is A-OK 👌, a bit shaky 😬, or totally kaput 😭.
*   **ICMP Pinging:** We send out tiny, harmless "pings" to check if servers are responsive. It's like playing digital Marco Polo!
*   **Sleek & Lightweight:** Designed to be a good citizen on your Mac, using minimal resources.

## 🛠️ What's Under the Hood?

For the tech-curious among us, Speckit is a native macOS application built with the latest and greatest from Apple:

*   **Swift & SwiftUI:** For a snappy, modern, and beautiful user interface.
*   **XPC Services:** We use a separate agent for the heavy lifting of network monitoring, keeping the main app light and responsive.
*   **ICMP Pinging:** The core of our monitoring is based on the good ol' Internet Control Message Protocol.
